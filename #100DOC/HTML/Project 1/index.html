If you ever want to amount to anything, you have to practice. If you do not practice, you do not fail. If you do not fail, you do not learn. Our greatest fear is not that we are inadequate, it is that we are powerful beyond measure. *mic drop*</p>

                    <li>Anyone</li>
                    <li>Todos</li>
                </ul>
                 Just sit down and practice something you're passionate about, dammit. Or something that can make you money. Put down the weed, turn off the tv, eliminate the distractions and just practice. Find your flow-state. </p>

            <h4 class= "header" id = "how-header">How Long Should You Practice?</h4>
                <p id = "how-exp">This is how long. As long as it takes. As long as you can stand. As long as it's still sinking in. The science is still out on how long the average human can concentrate. Or maybe they're not. Eiher way, I'm sure they're skewing the results to align with the best interests of capitalism. Basically, just practice. Thirty minutes of practice everyday is better than three hours of practice once  a week.</p>
